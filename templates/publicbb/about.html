                <p class="text-secondary mb-4">
                    Most trade businesses fail because they have a blind spot. They know their bank balance, but they don't know their <strong>Unit Economics</strong>.
                </p>
                <p class="text-secondary mb-4">
                    We built Business Better to fix that. By integrating <strong>HR (Next-of-Kin & Pay Rates)</strong>, <strong>Fleet Compliance</strong>, and <strong>Financial Data</strong> into one system, we eliminate the blind spots.
